<h3>Lundum Dare</h3>
<h4>LD 50</h4>
<p>For lundum dare 50 the theme was 'Inevitable' for this I paired up with <a href="https://mistagiggles.github.io/">Mista Giggles</a>.
</br>We worked on a game called 'Inevitable Dungeon' a small dungeon crawler where death is Inevitable.</p>
<p> The game can be played on my <a href="https://surfa.itch.io/inevitable-dungeon">ITCH.IO page</a>. This is the version that was submitted at the end of the jam without any bug fixes. </br>
We know of a couple of game-breaking bugs involving the death and 'death-bag' mechanics</p>
